1. One professional elective was offered by AU-2017 "Advanced Topics on Databases".
2.No changes in the first and second units.The last unit of AU-2017 was puhed to 3rd unit.
The 4th and 5th units are new units.
3.Syllabus is different from M.E syllabus
4.Five course outcomes are specified and alligned with units.
5.Not Applicable.
