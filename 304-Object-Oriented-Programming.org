- 1. The contents of units 3, 4 and 5 of this syllabus have been changed when compared to Anna University R-2017. Comments have been added along with the units
- 2. The same course is not offered in P.G. Hence, there is no requirement for comparison of this syllabus with PG syllabus
- 3. Five course outcomes are specified and are aligned with the units
- 4. Suggestive experiments have not been specified in this syllabus as it is not an integrated course. There is seperate lab course available

** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To learn the basics of Object Oriented Programming 
- To know the principles of inheritance and polymorphism
- To learn the concepts of generic methods and  generic collections.

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT I | INTRODUCTION | 10 |
Principles of OOP: Classes -- Objects -- Data hiding -- Data
encapsulation -- Inheritance -- Polymorphism; Definition of Classes:
Objects -- Methods -- Access specifiers -- Static and final classes
and members; Object Construction and Destruction -- Fundamental
programming structures in Java; Streams: Input-Output -- Examples in
Java.

#+begin_comment
Retain 
      Introduction to the OO concepts and fundamental programming structures in Java 
Inclusion
      I/O streams
#+end_comment

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT II | INHERITANCE 	 | 10 |
Inheritance: Definition -- Types of inheritance: Single -- Multilevel
-- Multiple -- Hierarchical -- Hybrid; Subclass constructors --
Interfaces in Java: Definition -- Implementation -- Extending
interfaces -- Inheritance versus delegation -- Inheritance rules --
Inner classes -- Examples in Java.

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT III | POLYMORPHISM AND EXCEPTION HANDLING	 | 7 |
Polymorphism: Method overloading and overriding -- Dynamic method
dispatch; Exceptions: Hierarchy -- Built-in exceptions -- Creating own
exception; Packages in Java -- Examples in Java.

#+begin_comment
Retain
	Exception handling
Inclusion
	Basic concepts of polymorphism and exception handling
Removal
	Since I/O streams (AU R-2017) have been studied in Unit I, it is removed
#+end_comment

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT IV | GENERIC TYPES AND METHODS	 | 9 |
Definition and concepts: Generic classes and generic methods --
Generic types -- Restrictions and limitations -- Inheritance rules for
generic types -- Reflections -- Examples in Java.

#+begin_comment
Retain
	Generic Programming 
Removal 
	Since, multithreading (AU R-2017) is specific to programming language, it is removed 
#+end_comment

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT V | GENERIC COLLECTIONS FOR ADTS AND ALGORITHMS	 | 9 |
Introduction to collections -- Collection Classes and Interfaces:
Array list -- Linked list -- Queue -- Set -- Trees; Iterators for
collections -- Map class -- Algorithms: Sorting -- Searching --
User-defined algorithms -- Examples in Java.

#+begin_comment
Removal
	Since event-driven programming (AU R-2017) is specific to programming language, it is removed 
Inclusion
	Generic collections have been included

** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able to: 
- Solve problems using classes and objects (K3)
- Develop programs using inheritance and interfaces (K3)
- Apply the concepts of polymorphism (K3)
- Design applications using generic programming (K3)
- Develop algorithms using generic collections (K3).
