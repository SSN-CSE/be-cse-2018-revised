** COURSE OBJECTIVES
   - To solve programming problems in C
   - To use basic programming concepts of C
   - To develop programs using loops, functions, arrays, pointers,
     strings, structures and files

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT I | BASICS | 9 |
Algorithm -- structure of a C program -- data types: built-in,
user-defined -- variables and constants -- input and output statements
-- operators, expressions, assignment statements -- control
statements.

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT II | FUNCTIONS | 8 |
Function prototype -- function definition and call -- passing
parameters -- built-in functions -- Scope: local, external, static,
blocks -- recursion; Pre-processor directives.

{{{unit}}}
|UNIT III|ARRAYS AND POINTERS |10|
Arrays: declaration, initialization -- one dimensional arrays --
multi-dimensional arrays; Pointers: pointer operators -- pointer
operations -- array of pointers, pointer to a function -- passing
arrays and pointers to functions.

{{{unit}}} 
|UNIT IV| STRINGS, STRUCTURES AND UNIONS|10|
Strings: constants and variables, reading and writing strings, string
operations, string library; Command line arguments; Structures: nested
structures -- structures and functions -- array of structures --
pointer to a structure -- unions -- type definition (typedef); Dynamic
memory allocation.

{{{unit}}}
|UNIT V| FILES|8|
Files: opening and closing a data file -- creating a data file --
processing a data file -- unformatted data files -- formatted input
and output -- line input and output -- file error handling; Standard
library functions.
