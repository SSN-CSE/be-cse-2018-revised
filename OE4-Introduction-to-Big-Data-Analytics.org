** SUGGESTIVE EXPERIMENTS
- Hadoop
  1. Applications using Map-Reduce programming (Examples: word count /
     frequency programs / matrix multiplication)

- R
  1. Linear and logistic Regression (Loan prediction using Credit
     approval dataset, Sales prediction using Bigmart dataset)
  2. SVM / Decision tree classification techniques (Flower type
     classification based on available attributes using Iris dataset,
     Passengers survival classification using titanic dataset)
  3. Clustering (Document categorization by multiclass techniques)
  4. Visualize  data  using  any plotting framework

- Database
  1. Application that stores data in Hbase (Sentiment analysis using
     twitter dataset)

** COURSE OUTCOMES
Upon the completion of the course the students should be able to: 
- Understand how to leverage the insights from big data analytics (K2)
- Understand and apply distributed computing for better storage of
  data (K3)
- Develop applications using Hadoop related tools(K4)
- Use database frameworks like Hive and Hbase for data analysis(K3)
- Solve applications using  statistical and data  analytic methods (K3).
