#+begin_comment
  1. As the course is focussed towards fundamental resource handling strategies, advanced techniques suggested like RELRO and ASLR are not included
  2. Since there exists a specific course on security in a higher semester, inclusion of security perspectives for operating systems theory and lab would be too early for second-year students
#+end_comment

#+begin_comment
 1. Unit V - Windows case study included
 2. Windows was added as a comparative study with Linux
 3. Not Applicable
 4. Five Course outcomes specified and aligned with units
 5. For lab, suggestive experiments are clearly defined.
