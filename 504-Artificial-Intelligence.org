- 1. This course syllabus is substantially different from the current one in Anna University curriculum in unit IV and V.
- 2. Unit IV, Uncertainty is given instaed of Software agents.Unit V, Introduction to Learning is given, instead of Applications.
- 3. Not Applicable
- 4. Five Course outcomes specified and aligned with units
- 5. Lab Exercises are given for each unit.
