#+begin_comment
1. Unit IV & V differ from AU2017. 
2. Unit I - Moved Topics on "Illumination and color Models" to Unit IV.Random and Raster scan systems are added as introductory topics.
   Unit III - B splines is removed as under spline representaions topic, Bezier curve is already given. Visible surface detection methods removed.
   Unit IV - Instead of Multimedia introduction, changed to Illumination models and added Animation. 
   Unit V - Has 3 1/2 important chapters from prescribed textbook as opposed to 8 chapters given as Unit 4 and 5 in AU2017 .
3. Not Applicable
4. Five Course outcomes specified and aligned with units
5. For Lab, suggestive experiments are clearly defined.
