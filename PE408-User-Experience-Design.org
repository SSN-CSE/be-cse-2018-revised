** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To develop skills in analyzing the UX in agile development
- To impart the skills required to create an Information Architecture
  document for a agile development
- To establish requirements for User Experience design concepts using
  techniques such as user stories
- To learn the agile concepts used by UX team in terms of backlog,
  feedback, and communication.

| UNIT I | CONCEPTUALIZING USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN  | 9 |
What are UX and UX design: Definition of UX -- UX design -- components
of UX -- What UX is Not -- Kinds of interaction and UX; UX processes,
Lifecycles, Methods and Techniques: Basic process components for UX --
fundamental UX lifecycle activities -- UX design techniques as life
skills -- Choosing UX processes, methods and techniques; Agile
lifecycle processes and the funnel model of Agile UX: Embracing an
agile lifecycle process -- funnel model of Agile UX -- Agile UX case
study.

Data Modeling: User work role model -- Flow model -- Task structure
models -- Artifact model -- Physical work environment model --
Information architecture model -- social model-- Hybrid models --
Model consolidation; UX design requirements: User stories -- UX Design
requirements -- validating user stories and requirements; Prototype
candidate design: Depth and Breadth of a prototype -- fidelity --

UX Evaluation methods: Data Collection techniques -- UX evaluation
methods; Data analysis: analyze Quantitative data -- analyze
qualitative UX data -- Reporting different kinds of data; Agile
concepts for UX teams: creating a user experience backlog -- constant
feedback and iteration -- thinking and communicating in terms of user
stories -- defining acceptance criteria.

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT V | ITERATION AND CASE STUDIES | 10 |
Iterations: working as a team -- design documentation -- working with
the product owner -- working in iterations -- continuous improvement;
Toolbox: As-is experience design review -- as-is/to-be process mapping
-- camera as documentation -- collaborative design -- competitor
review -- context scenarios -- customer experience -- customer testing
-- task analysis -- trade-off sliders -- case study.
