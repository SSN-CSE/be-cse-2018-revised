** COURSE OBJECTIVES
   - To develop, implement, and execute C programs.
   - To use various  programming constructs and features  in C  
   - To understand  the concept of modular programming  using functions  

** SUGGESTIVE EXERCISES
   1. Programs using I/O statements and conditional constructs (if,
      switch, ternary)
   2. Programs using looping constructs (for, while, do-while)
   3. Programs using functions with different parameter passing
      techniques: Call by value (e.g. swapping two numbers), call by
      reference (e.g. changing the elements of an array), Recursion
      (e.g. binary search)
   4. Programs using one dimensional arrays (e.g.  inserting an
      element after every ith position in an array, Insertion sort)
   5. Programs using multi-dimensional arrays (e.g. matrix
      manipulations)
   6. Programs using strings and their operations (e.g.  concatenation
      of strings, extracting a substring, checking for palindrome,
      search for a given string using binary search)
   7. Programs to demonstrate pointers to functions (e.g. simple
      arithmetic calculator)
   8. Programs to demonstrate simple structure manipulations
      (e.g. generating a transcript with CGPA and class obtained)
   9. Programs to pass structures to functions (e.g. operations on
      complex numbers, difference between times)
   10. Programs to pass array of structures to a function
       (e.g. generate invites to N parents for a meeting by passing
       the details of students)
   11. Programs to demonstrate file operations (e.g. count the number
       of characters, words and lines in a file, replace a specific
       word with the given word in the same file)

** MINI PROJECTS
Develop an application modularly using C programming
constructs. (Eg. Library management system, Online ticket reservation
system -- Train/Bus/Airways, Hotel reservation system)

\hfill *Total Hours: 45*

** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able to
1. Implement C programs, compile, debug, and execute (K2)
2. Implement programs in C with correct data representation and
   appropriate programming constructs (K4)
3. Compare arrays and pointers in C (K3)
4. Use structures and files in C (K3)
5. Develop programs modularly and refine incrementally (K3).
