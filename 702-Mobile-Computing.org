1. Fifth unit is reframed according to industry needs. All other units are already discussed in AU-2017.
2. For changes, see the individual units, some units were reordered
3. This subject is partially offered under M.E syllabus as Mobile and Pervasive Computing (elective), but the syllabus is entirely different.
4. Five Course outcomes specified and aligned with units.
5. Done.

** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- Understand the basic concepts of mobile computing
- Be familiar with the protocol stack
- Be exposed to Ad-Hoc networks
- Learn the basics of mobile telecommunication system
- Gain knowledge about different mobile platforms and application
  development environments.

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT I | INTRODUCTION | 9 |
Introduction to Mobile Computing; Media Access Control (MAC):
Motivation for a specialized MAC-- SDMA -- FDMA -- TDMA -- CDMA --
Comparison of S/T/F/CDMA; Wireless LAN: Infrastructure based and adhoc
networks -- IEEE 802.11 -- Bluetooth.

#+begin_comment
Retain
	MAC Protocols
Inclusion
	Wireless LAN - students should know there are two types of WLAN  
Removal
 Since multiplexing and spread spectrum have been already studied in Principles of Communication (Unit I and II) III semester in Autonomous Syllabus, it is removed
 Applications of Mobile Computing, Generations of Mobile Communication covered in Introduction, it is not mentioned in the syllabus.

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT II | NETWORK LAYER | 9 |
Mobile IP: Goals, assumptions and requirements -- Entities and
terminology -- IP packet delivery -- Agent discovery -- Registration
--Tunneling and encapsulation -- Optimizations; DHCP; AdHoc: Routing
-- Proactive routing protocol-DSDV -- Reactive routing protocol - DSR,
AODV -- Hybrid routing â€“ZRP -- Multicast Routing- ODMRP; VANET.

#+begin_comment
In order to learn layer wise for better understanding, we have shifted
Unit III and Unit IV of AU R-17 to Unit II and Unit III . Hence Unit
II of AU-R-17 is moved to Unit IV.

Therefore, the changes of Unit II is compared with Unit III of AU
R-17.

Retain
	Mobile IP and Adhoc Routing
Removal
 	Security is vast - if included it will be overdumped, so it is removed

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT III | TRANSPORT AND APPLICATION LAYER | 9 |
Mobile Transport Layer: Traditional TCP -- Classical TCP improvements;
Wireless Application Protocol(WAP): Architecture -- WDP -- WTLS -- WTP
--WSP -- WAE -- WML --WTA.

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT IV | MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEM | 9 |
Introduction; Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM): Mobile
services -- System architecture -- Radio interface -- Protocols --
Localization and calling -- Handover -- Security; General Packet Radio
Service (GPRS); Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS): UMTS
system architecture -- UTRAN -- Core network -- Handover.

#+begin_comment
Retain
	GSM, GPRS, UMTS
 	Frequency Allocation, Routing, Mobility Management in AU R-17 is covered in different topics name such as Radio Interface,     
	Localization & Calling and Handover.
Removed 
	Security in UMTS is removed due to vastness of the portion.
