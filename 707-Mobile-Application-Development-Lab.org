#+begin_comment
1. The same lab is there in AU-R2017, but we have added hybrid mobile application in addition to native application
2. Changes are:
Deletions 
        Sending Email, RSS Feed - Reason:  Email not much used, RSS will not work in Proxy
Addition
        Hybrid mobile application, keyboard based app, menus were added 

3. The same lab is in AU-R2017, but we have additional added some experiments and removed some as mentioned above.
4. 5 Course outcomes have been specified and it was aligned with the experiments given.
5. Done.
