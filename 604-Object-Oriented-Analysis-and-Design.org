** Course Objectives
1. To understand and differentiate Unified Process from other approaches 
2. To understand object-oriented software design using UML's static diagrams
3. To understand software modeling using the UML's dynamic diagrams
4. To learn improving software design with design patterns
5. To learn testing the software with its requirements specification.
