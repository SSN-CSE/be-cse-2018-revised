** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able to: 
- Implement SLD resolution using LISP (K3)
- Develop programs in Prolog (K3)
- Explain and compare the different models of uncertainty (K3)
- Use OSP5 interpreter (K2)
- Build a knowledge base for a particular problem domain, using PROLOG
  and/or LISP (K3).
