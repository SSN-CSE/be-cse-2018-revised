We are not aware of any Logic in Computer Science course in Anna University curriculum. 
This syllabus is completely independent of any Logic in Computer Science course.

** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To understand the role of logic in modeling and reasoning about systems
- To learn the syntax and semantics of various logics
- To write formal specifications in various logics
- To learn resolution for propositional and predicate logic
- To learn natural deduction for modal logic
- To program using SAT-SMT Solvers.

{{{unit}}}
|UNIT I|PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC|9|
Foundations: Syntax and semantics -- Mathematical induction --
Soundness and completeness; Semantic Entailment: Natural Deduction;
Normal Forms; PSAT Problem; Horn Logic; DPLL; CDCL.

#+begin_comment
Topic on Resolution moved from Unit I to Unit IV.

|UNIT II|PREDICATE LOGIC|9|
Foundations: Syntax and semantics; Semantic Entailment: Natural
deduction; Normal Forms; Undecidability of Predicate Logic; Herbrand's
Theory.

#+begin_comment
Topics on Resolution moved from Unit II to IV. Extensions of
Resolution dropped.

{{{unit}}}
|UNIT III|MODAL LOGIC|9|
Modes of truth; Basic Modal Logic: Syntax -- Semantics; Logic
Engineering: The stock of valid formulas -- Important properties of
the accessibility relation -- Correspondence theory -- Some Modal
Logics; Natural deduction; Reasoning about Knowledge in a Multi-agent
System: Examples -- Modal Logic KT45n -- Natural deduction for KT45n --
Formalising the examples.

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT IV | SAT SMT SOLVERS | 9 |
Resolution: Ground resolution -- Unification; Satisfiability Solvers:
Definitions and Notations -- SAT solver technology -- Complete
methods; Satisfiabilty Modulo Theories: Introduction -- Background --
Eager encoding to SAT -- Integrating theory solvers into SAT engines.

#+begin_comment
Unit on SAT-SMT Solvers introduced in place of Logic Programming.

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT V | MODEL CHECKING | 9 |
Motivation for verification; Linear-time Temporal Logic: Syntax --
Semantics -- Practical patterns of specifications; Model Checking: The
NuSMV model checker -- Case studies; Branching-time Logic: Syntax --
Semantics -- Practical patterns of specifications; Model-checking
Algorithms: The CTL model-checking algorithm -- The LTL model-checking
algorithm; CTL* and the expressive powers of LTL and CTL.
