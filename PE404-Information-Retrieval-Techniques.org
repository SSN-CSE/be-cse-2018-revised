** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To understand the basics of information retrieval with pertinence to
  modeling
- To understand various components of IR system
- To understand machine learning techniques for text classification
  and clustering
- To explore various IR applications.

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT I | INTRODUCTION AND MODELING | 9 |
Basic Concepts: Retrieval process -- Architecture -- Boolean retrieval;
IR Models: Taxonomy and characterization of IR models -- Classical IR
models -- Alternative algebraic models -- Models for Browsing -- Retrieval
Evaluation: Performance evaluation.

#+begin_comment

- 1. In AU syllabus searching is covered in Unit 1, 3 and 4. We have unified the topics related to search in Unit 3.
- 2. IR modeling and evaluation for Unit 2 of AU is moved to this unit
- 3. Removed set theoretical model and reference collection from M.E syllabus
#+end_comment


{{{unit}}}
| UNIT II | INDEXING AND QUERYING | 9 |
Indexing: Inverted indices -- Suffix trees -- Suffix arrays --
Compression; Querying: Query languages; Query Operations: Relevance
feedback and query expansion -- Automatic local and global analysis.

#+begin_comment

- 1. In AU, topics related to indexing is given along with modelling and querying topics are with classification and clustering.
- 2. Indexing and querying are the major components of IR and hence included as a seperate unit here.
- 3. Removed text properties and text operations from M.E syllabus
#+end_comment

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT III | SEARCHING | 9 |
Searching: Sequential searching -- Pattern matching; Searching the
Web: Characteristizing the Web -- Search engines -- Browsing --
Searching using hyperlinks.

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT IV | CLASSIFICATION AND CLUSTERING | 9 |
Text Classification: Naive Bayes; Vector Space Classification: Rocchio
-- k-Nearest Neighbour; Flat Clustering: K-Means -- Model-based
clustering -- Hierarchical clustering -- Matrix decompositions and latent
semantic indexing.

#+begin_comment
- 1. Removed Decision tree, SVM and dimensionality reduction from AU.
#+end_comment

{{{unit}}}
|UNIT V|APPLICATIONS|9|
XML Retrieval -- Multimedia IR -- Parallel and Distributed IR --
Digital Libraries -- Social Media Retrieval -- Content-based Image
Retrieval -- Online Public Access Catalogs (OPACs).

#+begin_comment
- 1. AU focused only on recommender system. Several applications are explored here
- 2. Added OPACs from M.E syllabus
