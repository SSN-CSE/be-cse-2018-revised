- 1. Almost the same as R2017 - changes done in Unit 4 and 5, so that course can be handled effectively within 45 hours.
- 2. For changes, see the individual units.
- 3. Not Applicable
- 4. Five Course outcomes specified and aligned with units

Removed: Clustering is made as separate unit and reduced the content so that particular topics in 
classification can be teached indepth
