** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To understand different client and server end technologies
- To develop web application using traditional technologies
- To understand and develop web applications using emerging web
  application frameworks.

{{{unit}}}
|UNIT I | WEB ESSENTIALS | 9 |
Web Essentials: Clients -- Servers -- Communication; Basic internet
protocols -- World wide web -- HTTP Request Message -- HTTP Response
Message -- Web Clients -- Web Servers; Web Server Security: Web server
vulnerabilities -- Effects and types of attacks -- Avoiding attacks on
web servers; HTML5: Tables -- Lists -- Image -- Redefined form
elements -- Semantic elements -- Audio and video controls -- CSS3:
Inline -- Embedded -- External style sheets -- Rule cascading --
Inheritance -- Adding graphics to web pages -- Transformations --
Transitions -- Animations.

{{{unit}}}
|UNIT II | CLIENT SIDE PROGRAMMING | 9 |
Client side programming language -- Javascript: Variables -- Data
types -- Statements -- Operators -- Objects -- Arrays -- Built-in
objects -- Event handling -- DOM: Introduction -- Document tree --
Node object -- Document -- Element -- Text nodes -- Event handling --
Event propagation.

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Removal
   Contents related to JSON in AU R-2017 has been removed
Thought Process
   Due to time constraint
   JSON is a structure used for tranferring data in web applications. Since it will not be explicitly  utilized for transfer in the development of web applications, it has been removed.      
#+END_COMMENT

{{{unit}}}
|UNIT III | SERVER SIDE PROGRAMMING| 9 |
Servlets: Architecture -- Life Cycle -- Parameter data -- Sessions --
Cookies and URL rewriting -- AJAX: Ajax Client Server Architecture --
XML Http Request Object -- Call Back Methods.

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Removal
    Contents related to JSP in AU R-2017 have been removed      
Thought Process
    Both servlet and JSP are serverside scripting languages
    Since Servlet itself is enough for the students to undertand the configuration of web applications, JSP has been removed
#+END_COMMENT

{{{unit}}}
|UNIT IV | CLIENT SIDE FRAMEWORK | 9 |
Introduction to ReactJS –- Pure react: React elements -– ReactDOM –-
Children -– Constructing elements with data -– React components;
Props, state and compoenet tree –- React router: Incorporation –-
Netsing -– Parameters; Communication of react with server.

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Removal
      PHP and XML in AU R-2017 have been removed
Thought Process
      PHP is yet another serverside scripting language
      XML is a structure used for tranferring data in web applications. Since it will not be explicitly being utilized for trasnfer in the development of web applications 

Inclusion
      Concepts related to ReactJS have been included
Thought process
      It is a recently developed lightweight client side framework useful for quick development of web application
#+END_COMMENT

{{{unit}}}
|UNIT V | SERVER SIDE FRAMEWORK | 9 |
Introduction to NodeJS –- Event Loop -– Patterns -– Core APIs:
EventEmitter -- Callback syntax -- Streams -- File system, -- Buffers
-- Process module -- Data Access -– NoSQL and Document stores:
MongoDB.

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Removal
      AJAX and Web services in AU R-2017 have been removed
Thought Process
      AJAX has been moved to Unit 3
      Time constraint
      Web services in a way is not much relevant with the development of web applications
      Having understood the basics of web application development, one can futher explore how web services can be used in the development of web application in future relatively better
Inclusion
      Concepts related to NodeJS have been included
Thought process
      It is a recently developed lightweight sever side framework useful for quick development of web applications
