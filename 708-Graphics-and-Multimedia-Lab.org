** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- Understand graphics programming in OpenGL using OpenGL and GLUT frameworks
- Implement algorithms for line and circle drawing
- Apply 2D, 3D transformations and clipping on objects
- Learn to draw 3D objects and apply projection techniques
- Explore image manipulation and enhancement techniques
- Create 3D animation using any tool.


** SUGGESTIVE EXPERIMENTS
1. Study of Basic output primitives in OpenGL
2. Implementation of Algorithms for drawing 2D Primitives –
   - Line (DDA, Bresenham) - all slopes   
   - Circle (Midpoint)
3. 2D Geometric transformations – Translation, Rotation, Scaling,
   Reflection and Shear
4. 2D Composite Transformations and Window to viewport mapping
5. Implementation of Line clipping algorithm
6. 3D Geometric Transformations - Translation, Rotation and Scaling
7. 3D Projections - Parallel and Perspective projection
8. Image Editing and Manipulation -
   - Basic Operations on image like applying masks, filters,
     adding/removing noise
   - Creating gif animated images
9. Creation of a simple 2D animation
10. Creation of a simple 3D animation

\hfill *Total Periods: 45*

** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able to: 
- Demonstrate drawing of basic output primitives (line and circle) using algorithms and hence draw complex shapes using them (K3)
- Illustrate basic, composite transformations and clipping on 2 dimensional objects (K2)
- Apply transformations and projections on 3 dimensional objects and develop any scene with features including lighting, textures, shadows, changing camera angles (K3)
- Apply basic operations on images, create GIF animated images and 2D animation sequence (K3)
- Develop a simple 3D animation (K3)

** LABORATORY REQUIREMENT FOR BATCH OF 38 STUDENTS
Hardware:\\
1. Standalone Desktop Machines - 38 Nos

Software:\\
1. C/C++/Java 
2. OpenGL/GIMP 
3. Blender/Maya
