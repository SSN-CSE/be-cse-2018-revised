** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To build software development skills using object oriented
  programming for real world applications
- To develop applications using inheritance and polymorphism
- To understand and implement generic programming.

** SUGGESTIVE EXPERIMENTS
1. Program using classes and objects (Eg: Electricity bill generation)
2. Program to perform string operations using ArrayList. 
3. Program to implement packages (Eg: Currency converter)
4. Program using Inheritance (Eg: Payroll application)
5. Prgram to implement Polymorphism (Eg. Area of different shapes)
6. Program to implement generic methods (Eg: Sorting)
7. Design a Java interface for ADTs. (Eg.Stack, Queue) 
8. Program to perform file operations. (Eg.existence, permission,type, length in bytes) 
9. Develop a mini project for any application using the constructs of Java. 


\hfill *Total Periods: 45*

** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able to: 
- Develop applications in Java using classes and methods(K3)
- Apply inheritance and interface concepts to write programs(K3)
- Write Java programs using polymorphic methods and objects(K3)
- Develop applications using generic methods and generic programming(K3)
- Apply appropriate features of oop programming paradigm to design mini project(K3).
